# Machine_Learning_To_Predict_Earthquackes
This is an attempt to use the findings of Wikelski m. et al 2020 to train a machine learning model to predict earth quakes within a span of 1 to 18 hours using the data they collected in Italy

#Abstract:
In the light of the recent tragedies that occured in Turkey and Syria from earthquakes that cuased the death of thousands in mere seconds 
we are left in a frankenstien of a reminder that our lives may at a whim of a second be in threat of an event that is well beyond our means 
of prevention and so every moment that is spent to run away from it is as valuable as all riches on earth as life is ireplacable with anything on this earth, 
and so in this study I will attempt to look for ways in which ML models may be used to predict earthquakes minutes or even hours before its occurence and if so 
my futile attempts are fruitfule this may alleviate the chances of surviaval to tenths of thousands of people if not more and with data that was collected 
by the teams of researchers from the Wikelski m. et al 2020 research study 

#Hypothesis:
With a ensumbles or individual models of Recurrent Nueral Networks, Deep Neural Networks,Logestic Decision Trees, clustring models, as well as ananolmaly detection models using gausian distribution
we may be able to build a model that predicts earhtquakes minutes or even hours before its occurence using data of average OBDA mean of cows, sheep, and dogs in the span of 15 minutes cycles
